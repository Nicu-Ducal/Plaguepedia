                <h3>
                    World Health Organization Declares COVID-19 a
                    'Pandemic.' Here's What That Means
                </h3>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                    The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 declared
                    COVID-19 a pandemic, pointing to the over 118,000 cases
                    of the coronavirus illness in over 110 countries and
                    territories around the world and the sustained risk of
                    further global spread. <br /><br />“This is not just a
                    public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch
                    every sector,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO
                    director-general, at a media briefing. “So every sector
                    and every individual must be involved in the fights.”<br /><br />An
                    epidemic refers to an uptick in the spread of a disease
                    within a specific community. By contrast, the WHO
                    defines a pandemic as global spread of a new disease,
                    though the specific threshold for meeting that criteria
                    is fuzzy. The term is most often applied to new
                    influenza strains, and the CDC says it’s used when
                    viruses “are able to infect people easily and spread
                    from person to person in an efficient and sustained way”
                    in multiple regions. The declaration refers to the
                    spread of a disease, rather than the severity of the
                    illness it causes.<br /><br />

                <p>
                    <b>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</b> is an
                    infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory
                    syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was
                    first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, Central China, and
                    has since spread globally, resulting in the 2019–20
                    coronavirus pandemic. Most people infected with the
                    COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate
                    respiratory illness and recover without requiring
                    special treatment. Older people, and those with
                    underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease,
                    diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are
                    more likely to develop serious illness.<br /><br />The
                    virus is typically spread from one person to another via
                    respiratory droplets produced during coughing. It may
                    also be spread from touching contaminated surfaces and
                    then touching one's face. Fecal–oral transmission is
                    also being studied as the virus has been found in
                    patients stool. Time from exposure to onset of symptoms
                    is generally between two and 14 days, with an average of
                    five days. The standard method of diagnosis is by
                    reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
                    (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. The infection can
                    also be diagnosed from a combination of symptoms, risk
                    factors and a chest CT scan showing features of
                    pneumonia.

                    <strong><em>The Spanish flu</em></strong>, also known as the 1918 flu pandemic, was an unusually
                    deadly influenza pandemic. Lasting from January 1918 to
                    December 1920, it infected 500 million people—about a
                    quarter of the world's population at the time. The death
                    toll is estimated to have been anywhere from 17 million
                    to 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million,
                    making it one of the deadliest epidemics in human
                    history.

                    and SARS-CoV-2, which since late 2019 has caused a
