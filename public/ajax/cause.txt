<p><b>Cause</b></p><hr><p id="text">The disease is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously referred to as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). It is primarily spread between people via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. The virus can remain viable for up to three days on plastic and stainless steel, and for three hours in aerosols. The virus has also been found in faeces, and transmission through faeces is being researched.<br><br>The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme ACE2, which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell. The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and some have suggested that decreasing ACE2 activity might be protective, though another view is that increasing ACE2 using Angiotensin II receptor blocker medications could be protective and that these hypotheses need to be tested. As the alveolar disease progresses, respiratory failure might develop and death may follow.<br><br>The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as the ACE2 protein is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelia. The virus has been found in the faeces of as many as 53% of hospitalised patients and more anal swab positives have been found than oral swab positives in the later stages of infection. Duration time of positive stool ranged from 1 to 12 days and 17% of patients remained positive in stool after showing negative in respiratory samples indicating that the viral gastrointestinal infection and the potential fecal-oral transmission can last even after viral clearance in respiratory tract. Reoccurrence of the virus has also been detected through anal swabs suggesting a shift from more oral positive during the early stages of the disease to more anal positive during later periods.<br><br>The virus is thought to be natural and have an animal origin, through spillover infection. It was first transmitted to humans in Wuhan, China, in November or December 2019, and the primary source of infection became human-to-human transmission by early January 2020. The earliest known infection occurred on 17 November 2019 in Wuhan, China.</p><figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Novel_Coronavirus_SARS-CoV-2.jpg/1024px-Novel_Coronavirus_SARS-CoV-2.jpg" alt="Coronavirus Image"><figcaption>Microscopy image showing SARS-CoV-2.
