<p><b>Signs and symptoms</b></p><hr><p id="text">Fever is the most common symptom, although some older people and those with other health problems experience fever later in the disease. In one study, 44% of people had fever when they presented to the hospital, while 89% went on to develop fever at some point during their hospitalization. <br><br>
Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages. Less common symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat. <br><br>
Some cases in China initially presented with only chest tightness and palpitations. <br><br>
A decreased sense of smell or disturbances in taste may occur. Loss of smell was a presenting symptom in 30% of confirmed cases in South Korea. <br><br>
As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person is first infected and the time he or she develops symptoms. This is called the incubation period. The incubation period for COVID‑19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days, although 97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. <br><br>
A minority of cases do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time. These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested, and their role in transmission is not yet fully known. However, preliminary evidence suggests they may contribute to the spread of the disease. In March 2020, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay. <br><br>
In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death. Neurological manifestations include seizures, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome. Cardiovascular-related complications may include heart failure, irregular electrical activity, blood clots, and heart inflammation. <br><br>
In some people, COVID‑19 may affect the lungs causing pneumonia. In those most severely affected, COVID-19 may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure. Complications associated with COVID‑19 include sepsis, abnormal clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver. Clotting abnormalities, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, have been described in 6% of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function is seen in 4% of this group. Approximately 20-30% of people who present with COVID‑19 demonstrate elevated liver enzymes (transaminases). Liver injury as shown by blood markers of liver damage is frequently seen in severe cases.</p>
