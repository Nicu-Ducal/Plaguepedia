<p><b>History, society and culture</b></p><hr><p id="text"><b>History</b><br><br>The virus is thought to be natural and has an animal origin, through spillover infection. The actual origin is unknown, but the first known cases of infection happened in China. By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission. A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID‑19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019. Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 December 2019. Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January 2020.<br><br>
<b>Name</b><br><br>During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus", with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia". In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Zika virus.<br><br>
In January 2020, the World Health Organisation recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species or groups of people in disease and virus names to prevent social stigma.<br><br>
The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019). The WHO additionally uses "the COVID‑19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID‑19" in public communications. Both the disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus" in the media and public discourse.<br><br>
<b>Misinformation</b><br><br>After the initial outbreak of COVID‑19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation emerged regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and rapidly spread online.<br><br>
